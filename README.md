As global investors increasingly prioritize sustainability and responsible investing, access to 
reliable, real-time data has become crucial in making informed financial decisions. With the 
growing importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, alongside the 
rapid changes in market sentiment driven by social media and news platforms, there is a need 
for an innovative tool that consolidates these insights into a single, easy-to-use platform.
